/**
 * @description Use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path
 * from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. This implementation
 * also delivers two vertex maps: the first tracks shortest distance from the
 * source, and the second tracks the final edge that leads to its shortest path.
 *
 * Strategy: Traverse all vertices using breadth-first search. Use a Set to
 * detect vertices already visited. Use a min heap to store vertices and their
 * shortest distance from the source known so far. Until the priority queue is
 * empty, greedily grab the minimum distance vertex. If unvisited, loop through
 * its edges to compare distances from the source. If a smaller distance is
 * found, update the distance, the parent, and add to the priority queue.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(ElogV)
 * Space complexity: O(E)
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY EXPLAINED
 * Breadth-first search operates in O(V + E), where V is total vertices and E is
 * total edges. Each search has the potential to trigger a priority queue
 * insertion, which operates in O(logV). Therefore, multiplying these two gives
 * O((V + E)logV), which simplifies to O(ElogV) because E > V.
 *
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY EXPLAINED
 * Without decrease key, the priority queue has the potential to add all edges
 * from the graph. Therefore, the space complexity is O(E), which is greater
 * than O(V) from the visited Set.
