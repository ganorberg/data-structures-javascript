/**
 * @description Use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path
 * from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. This implementation
 * also delivers two vertex maps: the first tracks shortest distance from the
 * source, and the second tracks the final edge that leads to its shortest path.
 *
 * Strategy: Traverse all vertices using breadth-first search. Use a Set to
 * detect vertices already visited. Use a min heap to store vertices and their
 * shortest distance from the source known so far. Until the priority queue is
 * empty, greedily grab the minimum distance vertex. If unvisited, loop through
 * its edges to compare distances from the source. If a smaller distance is
 * found, update the distance, the parent, and add to the priority queue.
 *
 * Time complexity: O((E + V) * logV), where V is total vertices and E is total edges
 * Space complexity: O(V + E), where V is total vertices and E is total edges
 *
 * TIME COMPLEXITY EXPLAINED
 * Each vertex will be removed from the priority queue once, which is a logV
 * operation on V vertices yielding VlogV. Each edge has the potential to be
 * inserted into the priority queue, which is a logV operation on E edges
 * yielding ElogV. Adding these two gives VlogV + ElogV = logV * (V + E)
 *
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY EXPLAINED
 * Without decrease key, the priority queue has the potential to add all edges
 * from the graph. This requires O(E) space. The visited Set will always take
 * O(V) space. Therefore, the space complexity is O(V + E).
